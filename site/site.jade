				h3 Skeleton
				p Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in action.
			.one-hird.column
				h3 Three Core Principles
				p Skeleton is built on three core principles:
				ul.square
					li A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile, elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile. 						
					li Fast to Start, it's a tool for rapid development with best practices
					li Style Agnostic, it provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten
			.one-third.column
